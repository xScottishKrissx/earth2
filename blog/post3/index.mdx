Thats the thing, it won't cost anything

Earth 1 is old news, so to preserve the integrity of the human race, Earth 2 is seen as the best way forward for everyone.

It's like forcing your neigbour to cut their grass because it's over the size stated in the HOA.

It just make sense.The earth 2 part, not the grass part. No one alive has ever seen real grass of course.
