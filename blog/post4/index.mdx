Once we've escaped Earth 1 atmosphere and navigated the 5 planets of our Solar System, the distance between Earth 1 and our new home is almost entirely empty space.

You won't notice any trouble regardless, as you will be tucked away in a deep sleep, nice and cosy in your hibernation chamber, as we leave the troubles of Sol behind.
